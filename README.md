## Setup Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/munzir/autonomous-tow-truck.git
   cd autonomous-tow-truck
   ```
2. **Set Up the Development Environment:**

   - Ensure you have ROS2 Humble installed on Ubuntu 22. Follow the [ROS2 Humble installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) if needed.
   - Optionally, set up the development environment using Docker:

     ```sh
     cd tools/docker
     docker build -t autonomous-tow-truck .
     ```

   - Run the development environment:

     ```sh
     docker run -it autonomous-tow-truck
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Install Python dependencies:

     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Build the Project:**

   ```sh
   colcon build
   ```

5. **Source the Setup File:**

   ```sh
   source install/setup.bash
   ```
## Usage

To launch the system or individual components, use the ROS2 launch files located in the `launch/` directory. For example:

```sh
ros2 launch launch/robot.launch.py
```

## Testing

Run the tests using the following commands:

- **Unit Tests:**

  ```sh
  colcon test --packages-select <package_name> --test-result
  ```

- **Integration Tests:**

  ```sh
  colcon test --packages-select <package_name> --test-result
  ```

- **Performance Tests:**

  ```sh
  colcon test --packages-select <package_name> --test-result
  ```
